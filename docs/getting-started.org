Welcome to Snakesnap! Please not this project is under active development and we welcome contributors. See *contributing* for more information on getting involved. 
** About
   Snakesnap is a project we built as part of the CU Denver Neuroscience program outreach event /Fantastic brains and where to find them/ at the Denver Science Museum in 2017. The focus of the event was how different and cool the brains and senses of different animals are. Snakesnap is meant to demonstrate "thermal vision" that snakes have thanks to their [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared_sensing_in_snakes][pit organs]] 
The first version was a really ugly command line script which prompted for name and email and then took and emailed a thermal picture of the user. Since then, we have been working on improving the system and especially designing a nice user interface so that anyone can set up and use this Snakesnap.
For this reason, snakesnap has been redesigned into a [[http://flask.pocoo.org/][Flask]] application that runs locally on a raspberry pi. While initial installation will require some command-line activity, I will try to walk you through it as best I can in this guide. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have issues. 
In the spirit of open science and education, Snakesnap software is released under the [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/][GNU GPLv3]].

   I will start with wiring and getting the lepton module tested and working, before moving on to using the Snakesnap 

** Wiring
Below is a [[http://fritzing.org/home/][Fritzing]] 

*TODO* Fritzing diagram

Connect the pins like so:

| FliR Module | Raspberry Pi 3B+ |
|-------------+------------------|
| CS          | CEO (24)         |
| MOSI        | MOSI (19)        |
| MISO        | MISO (21)        |
| Clk         | SCLK (23)        |
| GND         | GND (any ground) |
| VIN         | 3.3V             |
| SDA         | SDA (3)          |
| SCL         | SCL (5)          |

I'd recommend using a breakout board and plugging these in via a breadboard, there are a lot of wires to connect. 

Now you should plug in your picamera and follow [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-picamera/worksheet/][this guide]] to ensure the camera is set up properly. 

** Enabling the camera and I_{2}C and SPI
   If you followed the camera tutorial, you should have entred the Raspberry Pi Configuration and enabled the camera. We now need to enable I_{2}C and SPI. Click *Start > Preferences > Raspberry Pi Configuration* and Enable I2C and SPI. I believe this only uses SPI, but enable them both. For more information on what these do, see the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus][SPI wikipedia]], which links to I_{2}C as well.

Reboot your pi by typing

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim 
sudo shutdown -r now
#+END_SRC

** Test the camera
Lets make sure the camera is working. 

If this is your first time using the pi, open a terminal and type
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim 
sudo apt-get install python pip
sudo pip install picamera
#+END_SRC

Then, copy this script into a text editor, save it as camera-test.py in your home folder. 

#+BEGIN_SRC python :session *ipython* :results output
#!/usr/bin/env python
from time import sleep
from picamera import PiCamera

camera = PiCamera()
camera.start_preview()
sleep(2)
camera.stop_preview()
print('Test complete')
#+END_SRC

Type the following in the terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim 
python camera-test.py
#+END_SRC

You will either see the camera take over the screen for 2 seconds before turning off, or you will see an error. If you see an error, return to the picamera [[https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/camera/python/README.md][setup page]].

** Testing FliR Lepton Thermal module
[[https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/flir-lepton-hookup-guide][Sparkfun]] has an excellent tutorial for setting up the FliR Lepton module. Please follow the instructions on this page, which walks you through compiling a C++ Qt video program to test the FliR module. The most common error is the red square problem. If this happens to you, DOUBLE CHECK YOUR WIRING FIRST! I spend an entire day troubleshooting this and it turned out my wiring was totally off... Always start with the simplest source of error before moving on. If this doesn't work for you, try googling around, there are a bunch of google groups where people suggest fixes. 
** Python controls
First, lets install the python pylepton project. 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim 
sudo pip install pylepton
#+END_SRC

Then, install some dependencies

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results verbatim 
sudo apt-get install python-opencv python-numpy
#+END_SRC

** Snakesnap interface
